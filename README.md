Simple Shell
This repository contains a simple UNIX command line interpreter implemented in C. The shell, named "simple_shell," allows users to execute commands through a command line interface.

Features
Displays a prompt and waits for the user to enter a command.
The prompt is displayed again after each command execution.
Supports command lines consisting of a single word.
Handles errors gracefully.
Handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
Does not implement advanced features such as semicolons, pipes, redirections, or special characters.
Usage
To use the simple_shell, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the source code using a C compiler.
Run the compiled binary file to start the shell.
Enter commands at the prompt and press Enter to execute them.
The output of the executed commands will be displayed on the screen.
To exit the shell, use the built-in command exit.
